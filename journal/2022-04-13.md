Although this is a little bit more 'into the weeds' than the functionality of Obsidian, I think [[Foam]] is going to be our answer. We'll have to execute various commands instead of just pressing a button, but once we become familiar with what they are it shouldn't be a problem.

Testing Todo
- [x] This is a ToDo.
- [x] This is another ToDo.
- [x] This is a third one.

From here I think we need to consider rebuilding the Founder's Journal as a private Repo based on Foam. This should contain the bulk of the private work we are doing. Within the Iterative Alchemy Labs Org we can create another Foam template and rename that one to Cardano 360 wiki. This will be our working repository for this project. The question then becomes whether we should have a Founder's Journal just for IA Labs. I think maybe so, but it has to only contain items pertaining directly to the projects there, so separation could become an issue.
